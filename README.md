# RPM specification files 

RPM spec files in this repository are meant for Fedora (or CentOS/RHEL) and to be built using Copr build system. These are **not** properly build packages and that's why there are not part of Fedora itself. This project just repackages already built binaries from upstream.

## Why bother?

Why unzipping something somewhere and/or setting path to have it work? It is way easier and nicer to use standard tooling provided by OS such as RPM and DNF to install and remove software.
